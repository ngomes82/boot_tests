C++ Specific Questions
--------------------------------

1) Write a Class with two constructors in c++. Have the default constructor use an initialization list.
  Have the other contructor pass in an argument and use assignment. What is the difference? What order will the initialization list follow?


//Constructor Example in C++
class ConstructorExample
{
	public:
		int Count;
		int* ExampleArr;

		//Example of an initialization list, Order of member decleration is order of initialization.

		ConstructorExample() : Count( 10 ), ExampleArr( new int[Count] )
		{

		}

		//Example of an assignment initialization. Initialization occurs just before body of constructor
		//then constructor body executes and assignments occur.

		ConstructorExample(int ArgCount)
		{
			Count = ArgCount;
			ExampleArr = new int[Count];
		}
};
//End Constructor Example
